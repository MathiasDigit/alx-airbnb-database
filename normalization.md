**We do not need to further normalize into 3NF because:**

*   **Each table has a simple primary key (UUID), so there is no partial dependency.**

*   **All fields depend only on the primary key, not on any non-key attribute.**

*   **There is no redundancy of information between columns (e.g., the user's name is not repeated in Booking or Message).**

*   **There are no multivalued or derived columns (no lists or calculated fields).**

*   **ðŸ‘‰ Therefore, the database is already in 3NF: clean, consistent, and free from unnecessary duplication. No adjustments needed.**
