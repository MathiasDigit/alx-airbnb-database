# Index Performance in PostgreSQL

This document explains how to improve query performance in PostgreSQL by creating indexes on frequently queried columns. It also demonstrates how to evaluate performance using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.

## üöÄ Why Indexes Matter

Indexes make data retrieval faster by allowing the database engine to locate rows without scanning the entire table.

They are especially useful on columns frequently used in:

* `WHERE` conditions
* `JOIN` operations
* `ORDER BY` clauses
* Aggregate functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Indexes

Here are some example `CREATE INDEX` statements based on common queries:

```sql
-- Index on user_id for faster lookup in the bookings table
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);

-- Index on status to speed up filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);

-- Composite index on user_id and status
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_status ON bookings(user_id, status);
```

## üìä Measuring Performance with EXPLAIN and ANALYZE

### 1. Before Creating Index

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id' AND status = 'confirmed';
```

Look for:

* `Seq Scan` (sequential scan = slow)
* Total cost and execution time

### 2. After Creating Index

```sql
-- Now run the same query again
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id' AND status = 'confirmed';
```

Look for:

* `Index Scan` (much faster)
* Reduced execution time and cost

## ‚úÖ Tips

* Use `EXPLAIN` for a query plan (no execution)
* Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for real execution time (use with caution)
* Drop unused indexes to save storage and improve write performance
